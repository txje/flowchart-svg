Adds flowchart-specific functionality to svg.js

This is certainly not the most elegant extension, and violates the purity of svg.js
... particularly with that .attr ._attr mess :-/

The following functions are added:

draw.rounded(width, height, radius)
  - draws and returns a simple rectangle with rounded corners

draw.angled(start, end, concavity[, radius])
  - draws and returns an angled line from start to end, concave "up" or "down"
  - corner is curved if radius is given

SVG.Line.arrow(size)
SVG.Polyline.arrow(size)
SVG.Path.arrow(size)
  - draws and returns an arrow at the END of the given path/line
